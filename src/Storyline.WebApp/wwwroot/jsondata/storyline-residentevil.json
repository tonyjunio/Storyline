Though the cult's leadership and R&D capabilities were decapitated, the animals they worshipped found their way onto the black market as bioweaponry. As of 2012, the cult's former mountain hideout in Valdelobos and the surrounding mountain range lie within an exclusion zone imposed by the Spanish government.[3]",

Perpetrated intentionally by A-GUA Industries, their A-Virus bioweapon infected a number of people in the Great Lakes and New York through the use of a branded drinking water. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, mutated into Zombies and fought with the NYPD. The outbreak was successfully contained and many of the Zombies were treated for the disease over the night.\n\nA-GUA Industries developed the A-Virus as a means of causing massive destruction in the United States and Canada. Rather than a terrorist motive, A-GUA\u0027s motivation was from its nihilistic take on society inspired by its leader, Glenn Arias, following the death of his wife in a CIA operation.",

The exact number of deaths is not known, and though law enforcement investigations linked at least 20 people to the incident evidence suggests it was far more than 100. All were committed by Jack and Marguerite Baker, their son Lucas and possibly Mia Winters, all under the ultimate control of Eveline, a human bio-weapon capable of controlling minds through a fungal contaminant called the Mold.",
