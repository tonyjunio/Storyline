Beginning with illegal human experimentation in the Summer of 2008 conducted by TRICELL Inc., Africa, they were soon purchased by an Islamist terrorist group based within Kijuju,[2] who sought to use it to recruit a large army with the goal of gaining independence through the massacre of foreigners. Though the Bioterrorism Security Assessment Alliance dismissed evidence of B.O.W.s being used in this manner as hearsay, the circumstantial evidence of Ricardo Irving being in the area led to a major operation to arrest him. The rebels were ultimately crushed in March 2009 at the cost of most of the BSAA operators, though the events in Kijuju exposed Tricell\u0027s smuggling ring.",
